## How to use AltoRank?

### Creating an accout
The first step is to create an account, which allows AltoRank to keep track of polls you post and participate in. AltoRank currently supports sign-up using email and password.

### Creating a poll

Creating a poll for your desired topic is simple. 

For example, let's create a poll named "Rank the greatest soccer players of all-time"

- Provide a list of available options for the ranking. We could provide Lionel Messi, Cristiano Ronaldo, Diego Maradona, Pele, Zinedine Zidane...etc 

- Choose the range in which users rank the options. For instance, we might provide 10 options but only allow users to rank from 1-5.

- Set poll results to public or private. Private poll results are only available to the poll created.

### Poll results

Users can now participate in your created poll

After the user submits, AltoRank provides an interface to view the results using various graphs and tables.
