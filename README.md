# Altorank

Welcome to AltoRank! A web application created by Carter Comeau.

## What is AltoRank?

AltoRank allows users to create and participate in polls for any topic imaginable. 

For example,

Create a poll for "Best Food"

After creating this poll, provide a list of desired choices for the rankings.

Now users participate in your poll. 
If you choose to have a ranking from 1-10, then users will fill out which foods they think are best from 1-10. 

After the user submits, AltoRank provides an interface to view the results using various graphs and tables. 
The results can be private to the creator, or public for all to view. 

The creator can now see real data for which food is considered best by users!

## Purpose

AltoRank wants to serve as a platform to fetch data for various topics, and provide real results for ranking creators or curious users.
