Welcome to AltoRank! A web application created by Carter Comeau.

## What is AltoRank?

AltoRank allows users to create rankings and complete rankings for any topic you can think of. 

For example,

I could create a ranking for "Best Food"

When I create this ranking, I provide a list of choices for the rankings. AltoRank also provides data for various categories, we could choose to use AltoRanks "food" choices instead of typing all those choices.

Now, users can log on and complete the ranking. If you choose to have a ranking of 1-10, then users will fill out which foods they think are best from 1-10. 

After the user submits, AltoRank then provides an interface to view this data on graphs and tables. This data can be private to the ranking creator, or public for all to view. The creator can now see real data for which food is considered best by users.

## Why is this useful?

AltoRank wants to serve as a platform to fetch data for various topics, and provide real results for ranking creators or curious users.
